## An anti-intelligence MEMO

I don't want to do any thing complicated, I just want to cook an awesome and simple MEMO in the cell phone.

It should asked the password for the MEMO, if the password is correct, it would segue to the content page.

In the content page you could change a theme, edit contents, save contents, and return the the last view.
